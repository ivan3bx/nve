# (N)ote, (V)iew, (E)dit

`nve` will be a lightweight note taking application in the spirit of [Notational Velocity](https://notational.net).
The goal is to point 'nve' to a directory of plain-text files, and quickly search, view, and create files in that directory.


## Current Status

- 2023/01 - Navigation, search and viewing.

## TODO

- Saving edits
- Creating new notes from search box
- Monitor FS changes to incrementally update DB
- Display snippet in search results
- Support renaming of notes (modal)
